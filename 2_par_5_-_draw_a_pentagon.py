# Draw a pentagon in less than 5 lines of Turtle code

## Hint: A complete turn to face back the original direction is 360 degrees
## Since a pentagon has 5 faces, you will need to turn 5 times to get the full 360 degrees

from turtle import Turtle, Screen

t = Turtle()
s = Screen()
s.title("Draw A Pentagon")

s.mainloop()
